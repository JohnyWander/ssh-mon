v1.0.0 -added processor monitoring
v1.0.1 -added RAM monitoring(almost)
v1.0.2 -fixed multi server processor monitoring - Queing Console.SetCursorPosition/write
v1.0.3 -Turned off console quick edit mode - app freezing when clicking on console window fixed
v1.0.4 -Ram monitoring works / changed defauklt namespace to program name from random mess

v1.1.0 - 
-Now you can use only one single private key for all servers, as SSH.NET's "ConnectionInfo" 
class isn't "Thread safe" - authentication errors, weird stuff happening,
(Key, and server config files ENCRYPTION with AES is coming soon to maximize safety)

-Slowed down timers from 1000 to 2000ms to lower chance of Console.SetCursorPosition and GetCursorPosition
messing GUI up
- Wrapped CPU and ram status edit functions in Task.Run(()=> ..).Wait() to lower "mess up" chance almost to 0
- Added functionality to reset gui, if somehow gui still gets messed up
